MMM

this is mmm-java, an attempt to build a voxel=based massively multiplayer sandboxing game with quests and everything one could imagine in a game.
furthermore, it is my attempt to learn some opengl.

enjoy the content with care since some code parts are unclear in terms of licensing, etc.

feel free to contact me if you want to help.
